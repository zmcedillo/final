# NPM module to run SonarQube Server and Cloud analyses

`@sonar/scan` makes it very easy to trigger SonarQube [Server](https://www.sonarqube.org)
and [Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io) analyses on a JavaScript code base, without needing
to install any specific tool or (Java) runtime.

This module is analyzed on SonarQube Cloud.

## Installation

_Prerequisite: Node v18+ (for v4 and above)_

_Prerequisite: Node v16+ (for [v3](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-npm/tree/3.5.0), otherwise use sonarqube-scanner [v2.9.1](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-npm/tree/2.9.1))_

This package is available on npm as: [`@sonar/scan`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sonar/scan)

To install the scanner globally and be able to run analyses on the command line:

```sh
npm install -g @sonar/scan
```

## Getting Started

If you want to run an analysis without having to configure anything in the first place, simply run the `sonar` command. The following
example assumes that you have installed SonarQube Server locally:

```
cd my-project
sonar
```

or you can use `npx` without installing:

```
cd my-project
npx @sonar/scan
```
